# Deep_Learning_ImageNet
This short project was a work assignment given during Polytechnique's advanced Machine Learning class (MAP541). We build an image recognition system. 

The first part of the homework consists in three questions to discover ImageNet

The second part uses resnet50 to recognise an image (in this case a dog)

The third part is the most interesting. We build a binary object recognition algorithm. I chose to compare banana VS soccer ball. We pretrain the network thanks to feature extraction and fine-tuning. With the fist method, we finally reach an accuracy of 94%, and 88% with the second method (both after 30 epochs).
